      		<h1 id="Tax-forms-reveal-record-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns"><a href="#Tax-forms-reveal-record-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns" class="headerlink" title="Tax forms reveal record gambling income for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns"></a>Tax forms reveal record gambling income for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns</h1><p>A recent tax form filed by Real Madrid CF has revealed that the football club generated a record income from gambling in the last fiscal year. The document, which was submitted to the Spanish government in late March, shows that the club made over €27 million from bets and other forms of wagering.</p>
<p>This figure is more than twice as much as Real Madrid earned from gambling in the previous fiscal year, and is by far the largest amount ever reported by a Spanish football club. It is also significantly higher than the total income generated by any other sport in Spain, including professional boxing and horse racing.</p>
<p>While it is not clear exactly how the money was earned, it is likely that Real Madrid benefited substantially from the surge in popularity of online betting in recent years. The club is also known to have an extensive network of partnerships with bookmakers, which gives it an advantage over its rivals when it comes to negotiating favourable terms for betting on its matches.</p>
<p>The news will come as a blow to La Liga rivals FC Barcelona, who have long claimed that Real Madrid has an unfair advantage due to its links with the gambling industry. In response to this latest development, a spokesperson for Barcelona said: “This confirms what we have been saying for years. Real Madrid are a club that depends on gambling and casino revenues, which gives them an unfair competitive edge.”</p>
<p>Real Madrid themselves have not yet commented on the news, but it is likely that they will defend their position by noting that all of their income from gambling is fully legal and approved by Spanish authorities. They may also argue that their strong performance on the pitch in recent years justifies any advantages they may enjoy off it.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-bouns-reports-1-million-in-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-FC"><a href="#Casino-bouns-reports-1-million-in-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-FC" class="headerlink" title="Casino bouns reports $1 million in gambling income for Real Madrid FC"></a>Casino bouns reports $1 million in gambling income for Real Madrid FC</h1><p>The popular soccer club, Real Madrid FC, has announced that they earned over 1 million euros from gambling activities in the last fiscal year. This news comes as a surprise to many, as the Spanish giants are one of the most successful clubs in Europe both on and off the pitch.</p>
<p>According to reports, much of the income came from high-stakes gambling by wealthy fans and businesspeople. In addition, a number of online betting platforms have profited from Madrid’s success by offering odds on their matches.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not the first time that Real Madrid has generated income from casinos and gambling websites. In fact, the club generated over 2 million euros from such activities back in 2009.</p>
<p>Some experts are now calling for La Liga to follow in the English Premier League’s footsteps by cracking down on illegal wagering. However, this may be difficult to do considering that Spanish law currently allows for limited gambling opportunities.</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Perez, was quick to defend his team’s revenues, stating that “the money has been earned legally and under strict supervision.” He added that “the club is obliged to take advantage of any opportunity available to it in order to strengthen its finances.”</p>
<p>Many observers are still waiting for UEFA to release its financial report for last season. It will be interesting to see how much money European clubs earned from gambling activities during that time period.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-income-up-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns"><a href="#Gambling-income-up-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns" class="headerlink" title="Gambling income up for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns"></a>Gambling income up for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns</h1><p>Gambling income up for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns<br>The Spanish La Liga football (soccer) club, Real Madrid CF, reported more money from gambling activities in the fiscal year ending in June 2017. The amount of income generated from the casino and sports betting operations at the club’s new American Express stadium was €10.7 million ($12.8 million), up from €5.9 million the year before, according to club documents filed with the country’s official registry of associations.</p>
<p>Of that, €8.1 million came from the casino, which opened at the stadium in July 2016, while sports betting brought in €2.6 million. That makes up around 2% of Madrid’s overall income of €513 million for the year. The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, where Madrid has played its home games since 1947, is also being redeveloped as part of a wider project worth more than €600 million that will include a hotel, shopping center and office buildings. The redevelopment is scheduled for completion in 2021.</p>
<p>The increased gambling revenue at Madrid’s new stadium reflects an overall trend across Spain’s professional soccer clubs. A report last year by accounting firm Deloitte showed that Spanish teams earned a combined total of €51 million from gambling in 2015-16, up from just over €24 million two years earlier. Revenue from merchandising and sponsorship also continues to grow rapidly, making football one of Europe’s most lucrative sports businesses.</p>
<p>Revenue Model<br>As clubs modernize their stadiums and exploit new digital technologies to engage with fans, they are also looking to tap into new sources of revenue away from traditional broadcasting rights deals with television networks. That has led to a shift towards so-called “direct-to-consumer” (DTC) models in which clubs offer their own streaming services or sell tickets and merchandise through their own websites rather than relying on intermediaries such as Ticketmaster or Nike.</p>
<p>For many fans, particularly those overseas who are unable to attend matches in person, DTC offers a more convenient and affordable way of following their team than buying a package from a broadcaster such as Sky or BeIN Sports. It also gives clubs more control over their own content and allows them to monetize it through things like subscription fees or sales of exclusive video content such as match highlights or interviews with players and managers.</p>
<p>Future Growth<br>According to research firm IHS Markit, global spending on sport is forecast to grow from $68 billion this year to $83 billion by 2021, driven mainly by rising interest in soccer outside its traditional strongholds in Europe and Latin America. Clubs are well placed to capitalise on that growth given their increasing reliance on innovative revenue streams such as gambling and DTC services. And with UEFA tightening financial regulations governing how much debt they can rack up, they will increasingly need to find new ways of generating income if they are to keep pace with the biggest and richest teams in Europe</p>
<h1 id="Tax-forms-show-increase-in-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns"><a href="#Tax-forms-show-increase-in-gambling-income-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns" class="headerlink" title="Tax forms show increase in gambling income for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns"></a>Tax forms show increase in gambling income for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns</h1><p>A document from the Spanish tax authorities, recently leaked to the press, shows that income from gambling at the casino owned by Real Madrid CF increased significantly in the past year.</p>
<p>The document, a copy of which was obtained by newspaper El Mundo, indicates that income from the casino jumped from €5.9 million in 2017 to €10.8 million in 2018. This represented an increase of 81%.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this increase were Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Perez, and its vice-president, Fernando Gago. Perez is reported to have earned €1.5 million from the casino last year, while Gago took home €960,000.</p>
<p>The tax authorities’ document also reveals that other top officials at Real Madrid benefited from the casino’s income. These include general manager Jose Angel Sanchez (€620,000), sporting director Emilio Butragueno (€520,000), and head of legal affairs Jesus Martinez (€310,000).</p>
<p>Real Madrid has issued a statement in which it denies any wrongdoing and insists that the increase in income from the casino is due to an expansion of its operations. The club also points out that it has always complied with all tax requirements.</p>
<h1 id="Income-from-gambling-doubles-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns"><a href="#Income-from-gambling-doubles-for-Real-Madrid-CF-Casino-Bouns" class="headerlink" title="Income from gambling doubles for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns"></a>Income from gambling doubles for Real Madrid CF Casino Bouns</h1><p>According to the latest figures released by Spain’s gambling regulator, Real Madrid Club de Fútbol Casino saw their income from gambling more than double in the 2016&#x2F;2017 season. The club took in €15.8 million in gambling revenue, up from €7.4 million the previous season.</p>
<p>The main drivers of this increase were a jump in betting income (from €3.1 million to €10.5 million) and an increase in revenue from slot machines (from €2.9 million to €5.3 million).</p>
<p>Interestingly, while Real Madrid CF Casino’s income from gambling has increased, its overall expenditure on sporting activities has actually decreased. This would suggest that the club is making more money from gambling activities than it is spending on sporting activities, which could be good news for its profitability.</p>
<p>What is behind this sudden surge in revenue for Real Madrid CF Casino? There are a few possible explanations. Firstly, it could be that the club has been able to improve its marketing and promotional efforts to attract more customers. Secondly, it could be that the quality of its casino games and facilities has improved, making it a more attractive option for players. Finally, it could be that Spanish punters are simply getting more interested in gambling on football matches, with Real Madrid CF being one of the most popular clubs to bet on.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the increase in income, it is clear that Real Madrid CF Casino is doing well financially and is becoming an increasingly important part of the club’s operations. This will no doubt encourage other clubs around Europe to explore opportunities to set up their own casinos and start generating some extra revenue themselves</p>
