      		<h1 id="What-is-Rabona"><a href="#What-is-Rabona" class="headerlink" title="What is Rabona?"></a>What is Rabona?</h1><p>The Rabona is a type of kick that is used in association football. The kick is performed by kicking the ball with the inside of the foot, around the obstacle of the standing leg, and contacting the ball with the outside of the other foot.</p>
<p>The rabona was developed in Argentina and named after Ricardo “Raboni” Infante who first performed the kick in a game for Estudiantes de La Plata in 1948. The move quickly became popular throughout South America, and has been used by many famous players, including Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>There are several variations of the rabona, but all involve kicking the ball behind the standing leg with the outside of the other foot. One variation, called the Wraparound Rabona, involves rounding behind the standing leg to take possession of the ball before kicking it forwards with your outside foot. Another variation, called Drag-the-Bag, sees you hold on to the back of the ball as you bring it round to be kicked.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Philadelphia-76ers"><a href="#What-are-the-Philadelphia-76ers" class="headerlink" title="What are the Philadelphia 76ers?"></a>What are the Philadelphia 76ers?</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The 76ers play their home games at the Wells Fargo Center. </p>
<p>The Sixers franchise was founded in 1946 as the Syracuse Nationals. In 1963, the Nationals moved to Philadelphia and were renamed the 76ers. The Sixers have won three NBA championships: in 1955, 1983, and 2001. </p>
<p>The team has a rich history, with some of the most iconic players in league history having played for them, including Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and Allen Iverson. </p>
<p>The Sixers had a dismal record for many years after their move to Philadelphia, but they have been on an upward trajectory in recent seasons. They made the playoffs in 2013–14 and 2014–15 before reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in 2016–17. </p>
<h1 id="The-Philadelphia-76ers’-Current-Roster"><a href="#The-Philadelphia-76ers’-Current-Roster" class="headerlink" title="The Philadelphia 76ers’ Current Roster"></a>The Philadelphia 76ers’ Current Roster</h1><p>The current roster of the Philadelphia 76ers is as follows: </p>

<h1 id="What-is-Real-Madrid-CF"><a href="#What-is-Real-Madrid-CF" class="headerlink" title="What is Real Madrid CF?"></a>What is Real Madrid CF?</h1><p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly known as Real Madrid, or simply as Real, is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. The club was formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and played its first official game in November 1902. Madrid won the 1957–58 European Cup, which was their first international title. The club played its first ever competitive match in 1902 against Arenas Club de Getxo.</p>
<p>Real Madrid also reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1962 which they played against Eintracht Frankfurt but lost 2-1. Winners of the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1974 and 1986, they reached the competition’s final for the third time in 2005, becoming the first team to do so since Milan in 1990. They also became the first team to retain their European crown by winning their fourth title in the 2007–08 season. They also lifted the Spanish Cup in 1957 and 2007. One of the most successful clubs domestically, Real Madrid have won 64 official titles (27 La Liga, 17 Copa del Rey, 5 Spanish Super Cup, 2 League of Champions&#x2F;Champions League, 3 UEFA Cups&#x2F;UEFA Europa League and 1 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup). The Blancos are also one of three clubs to have never been relegated from La Liga (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), being at all times members of Spain’s top division.</p>
<p>With a record 22 Liga titles and 11 Champions League trophies (including 4 consecutive wins from 2016-2020), Los Blancos are one of Europe’s most decorated clubs. They are also one of three founding members of La Liga who have never been relegated from the division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. In domestic football, they have scored more than 4,700 goals in over 112 years of play.</p>
<h1 id="When-did-Rabona-form"><a href="#When-did-Rabona-form" class="headerlink" title="When did Rabona form?"></a>When did Rabona form?</h1><p>Rabona is a footballing move, made famous by Argentine footballer Denis Ginzburg. The manoeuvre involves kicking the ball around the supporting leg (in this case, the right leg) and then trapping it with the same foot before playing it on with the other. </p>
<p>The rabona has been around for many years but was not always called a “rabona.” Some people argue that it originated from ancient Greece, when a player would flick the ball over their head with their heel and then catch it with their instep. It wasn’t until 1948 that the rabona got its nickname. That year, an Argentine player named Denis Ginzburg scored a goal using the move during a match against Brazil. After that, the rabona became popular throughout South America. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1970s that rabona made its way to Europe. André Villas-Boas, a Portuguese football coach, is credited with bringing the move to Europe. He used it while coaching FC Porto and eventually helped make it popular in England. Today, the rabona is used by footballers all over the world.</p>
