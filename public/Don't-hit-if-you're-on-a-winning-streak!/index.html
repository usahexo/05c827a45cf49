      		<h1 id="Don’t-hit-if-you’re-on-a-winning-streak"><a href="#Don’t-hit-if-you’re-on-a-winning-streak" class="headerlink" title="Don’t hit if you’re on a winning streak!"></a>Don’t hit if you’re on a winning streak!</h1><p>You may have heard of the saying, “Don’t hit if you’re on a winning streak.” It’s a good piece of advice - especially in blackjack where you can easily go on a winning streak.</p>
<p>In blackjack, your goal is to get as close to 21 without going over as possible. If you’re playing against the dealer and your first two cards add up to 21 (called a blackjack), you automatically win the hand. In addition, if your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card (a blackjack), you automatically win - no matter what the dealer has.</p>
<p>If you’re not near 21, you can hit (take another card) or stand (keep your current cards). If you hit and get closer to 21 than the dealer, you win the hand. If the dealer goes over 21, she busts and everyone else at the table wins.</p>
<p>So why would you want to hit if you’re on a winning streak? The answer is that it’s not always wise to simply stand on your current total. For example, let’s say you have an Ace and a 6 as your first two cards. Your total is 7 and the dealer has an Ace showing. The odds of the dealer getting a blackjack are about 1 in 4 at this point, so it’s not worth hitting and risking going over 21. However, if the dealer has a 2 or 3 showing, your odds of winning go up if you hit since there’s a good chance she’ll end up with a total of 18 or less.</p>
<p>In general, then, it’s usually best to hit when the dealer has low cards showing and stand when she has high cards showing. But remember - if you’re on a winning streak, don’t hit!</p>
<h1 id="Save-your-hits-for-when-you-need-them-the-most"><a href="#Save-your-hits-for-when-you-need-them-the-most" class="headerlink" title="Save your hits for when you need them the most"></a>Save your hits for when you need them the most</h1><p>The average person has around five to seven major life changes or challenges in their lifetime. These could be anything from graduating college, getting married, or having children. For many people, these monumental moments are the times when they need their energy and best selves the most. And yet, we often reserve our hardest work and best performances for the times when we don’t really need them.</p>
<p>Think about it – how many times have you put in a lot of effort for a presentation at work, or busted your butt in the gym for a week leading up to a vacation? Odds are, you do this because you know that you’ll actually need the energy and results later on. But what about the other 95% of your life? When is the last time you really pushed yourself outside of your comfort zone?</p>
<p>It can be tough to summon up the energy for big challenges when they’re not necessarily urgent, but it’s worth it to try. Here are a few tips for saving your best performances for when you really need them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find your motivation</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to challenging yourself, motivation is key. You need to find something that’s worth fighting for – whether it’s reaching a personal goal, impressing your boss, or simply proving yourself wrong. Once you have a clear purpose in mind, it will be much easier to push yourself past your comfort zone.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>A good plan will help keep you focused and on track when things get tough. Having specific steps laid out will also help minimize any anxiety or stress that might come with taking on a new challenge. So take some time to map out exactly what you need to do in order to achieve your goal.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set attainable goals</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no sense in putting too much pressure on yourself by setting unrealistic goals. Start small and gradually build up as you gain confidence. This will help make sure that you don’t get overwhelmed while still providing enough of a challenge to keep things interesting.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Take some time for self-reflection</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of each day (or even week), take some time to reflect on how you performed against your goals. This will help keep you accountable and allow you to make course corrections as necessary. Plus, it just feels good to give yourself credit where credit is due!</p>
<h1 id="Know-when-to-hold-‘em-know-when-to-fold-‘em"><a href="#Know-when-to-hold-‘em-know-when-to-fold-‘em" class="headerlink" title="Know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em"></a>Know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em</h1><p>In any given poker game, players must make a series of important decisions. One question that is often debated is when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em.</p>
<p>There are different schools of thought on this subject, but most experts would agree that folding is generally the better option in marginal situations. This means that if the odds of winning the hand are not good enough, folding is the right play.</p>
<p>In many cases, folding can be the difference between winning and losing a hand. By folding when you should, you’re able to preserve your chips and stay in the game longer. This gives you more opportunities to win future hands and increase your overall chip stack.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when it makes sense to hold ‘em even if the odds are not in your favor. If you have a strong hand and your opponents are likely to fold, then holding may be the best option.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual player to decide when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. You need to consider all of the factors involved in each decision, including the strength of your hand and the amount of money at risk.</p>
<p>Making correct decisions in poker can be the difference between winning and losing money. So remember: know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em!</p>
<h1 id="Wait-for-the-perfect-opportunity-before-you-hit"><a href="#Wait-for-the-perfect-opportunity-before-you-hit" class="headerlink" title="Wait for the perfect opportunity before you hit"></a>Wait for the perfect opportunity before you hit</h1><p>Many people make the mistake of not waiting for the right opportunity before they act. They see an opportunity and they take it, without thinking if it is the right one for them. This can lead to a lot of problems, because you may not be fully prepared for what you are doing.</p>
<p>It is important to wait for the perfect opportunity before you take any action. This means that you have to assess all of your options and make sure that you are taking the right one. There is no need to rush into anything, because you may end up regretting it later on.</p>
<p>Waiting for the perfect opportunity also allows you to build up your skills and knowledge. If you don’t have the skills or knowledge to do something, then it is not going to be successful. You need to make sure that you are ready for whatever comes your way.</p>
<p>The best way to wait for the perfect opportunity is to focus on your goals. Make sure that your goals are clear and concise, so that you know what you are aiming for. Once you have your goals in mind, start working towards them by taking small steps. This will help get you closer to your goal and increase your chances of success when the time comes.</p>
<h1 id="When-in-doubt-don’t"><a href="#When-in-doubt-don’t" class="headerlink" title="When in doubt, don’t"></a>When in doubt, don’t</h1><p>We’ve all been there. You have a meeting with your boss, and you’re not sure if you should be pitching your new idea or sticking to the status quo. Or maybe you’re at a party and you don’t know whether to make small talk or jump in the deep end. When in doubt, don’t.</p>
<p>It can be tough to know when to take a risk and when to play it safe, but following one simple rule can help: When in doubt, don’t. This applies whether you’re making a decision or trying something new.</p>
<p>Of course, there are times when taking a risk is the right thing to do. But if you’re not sure whether an opportunity is worth it, it’s usually best to hold off. Playing it safe may not seem exciting, but it can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p>
<p>So before you leap into something new, ask yourself whether you’re really confident in what you’re doing. If the answer is no, it’s probably best to wait until you feel more sure of yourself. Making a decision based on doubt is rarely a good idea – so when in doubt, don’t.</p>
