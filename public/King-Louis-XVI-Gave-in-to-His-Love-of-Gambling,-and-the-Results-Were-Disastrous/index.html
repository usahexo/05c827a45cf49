      		<h1 id="King-Louis-XVI-Gave-in-to-His-Love-of-Gambling-and-the-Results-Were-Disastrous"><a href="#King-Louis-XVI-Gave-in-to-His-Love-of-Gambling-and-the-Results-Were-Disastrous" class="headerlink" title="King Louis XVI Gave in to His Love of Gambling, and the Results Were Disastrous"></a>King Louis XVI Gave in to His Love of Gambling, and the Results Were Disastrous</h1><p>The French Revolution is one of the most pivotal moments in European history, and it all began with the reign of King Louis XVI. Unfortunately, Louis was more interested in gambling and womanizing than he was in ruling his country, which eventually led to his downfall.</p>
<p>Louis was born in 1754 to King Louis XV and Queen Marie Leszczyńska. He had a fairly typical childhood, except that he was taught how to gamble by his father. As he grew older, Louis became more and more obsessed with gambling, to the point where it started to affect his political decisions.</p>
<p>In 1775, Louis married Austrian Princess Maria Antoinette. The two were never truly meant for each other; Louis was more interested in his gambling buddies than he was in his wife. As a result, their marriage was not very happy.</p>
<p>In 1789, the people of France revolted against the monarchy. Louis XVI attempted to quell the uprising, but ultimately failed. In 1793, he was arrested and sent to prison. He was executed two years later.</p>
<p>Louis XVI’s love of gambling led to his downfall and helped spark the French Revolution. If he had been a more attentive ruler, things may have turned out very differently for France.</p>
<h1 id="French-King-Louis-XVI’s-Gambling-Problem-Spurred-on-by-wife-Marie-Antoinette"><a href="#French-King-Louis-XVI’s-Gambling-Problem-Spurred-on-by-wife-Marie-Antoinette" class="headerlink" title="French King Louis XVI’s Gambling Problem Spurred on by wife Marie Antoinette"></a>French King Louis XVI’s Gambling Problem Spurred on by wife Marie Antoinette</h1><p>The French king Louis XVI, who has long been criticized for his lack of understanding in politics and his ineptitude as a leader, is now also being scrutinized for his problems with gambling.  It has long been known that the king had a serious addiction to gambling and would often lose large sums of money while betting on games of chance.  What has recently come to light, however, is the role that his wife Marie Antoinette played in exacerbating these problems.</p>
<p>Many historians believe that Marie Antoinette was a major influence on Louis XVI’s gambling habits and that she would often egg him on to keep betting.  It is thought that she did this in an attempt to make him look more impressive to the public and to divert attention away from her own lavish spending habits.  In addition, Marie Antoinette was said to enjoy gambling herself and may have even taken part in some of the bets made by her husband.</p>
<p>While there is no concrete evidence to support this theory, it is clear that Marie Antoinette had a considerable amount of power over Louis XVI and that she was not afraid to use it.  Her actions may have contributed not only to the king’s gambling problem, but also to his eventual downfall during the French Revolution.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Did-King-Louis-XVI-Lose-in-Gambling-at-Versailles"><a href="#How-Much-Did-King-Louis-XVI-Lose-in-Gambling-at-Versailles" class="headerlink" title="How Much Did King Louis XVI Lose in Gambling at Versailles?"></a>How Much Did King Louis XVI Lose in Gambling at Versailles?</h1><p>King Louis XVI, who ruled from 1774 until he was overthrown and executed during the French Revolution in 1793, was a notorious gambler. In fact, his gambling debts were one of the causes of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>One popular story is that on one particularly bad night of gambling at Versailles, Louis XVI lost 10 million livres (about $2 million in today’s currency). While there’s no definitive proof that this actually happened, it’s a pretty believable story, given how much Louis XVI loved to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition to losing vast sums of money in gambling, Louis XVI also wasted huge amounts of money on other luxury items and frivolous expenditures. In fact, his total personal debt when he was overthrown amounted to about $800 million in today’s currency. That’s a lot of money to lose on bad bets!</p>
<h1 id="Louis-XVI’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Led-to-the-French-Revolution"><a href="#Louis-XVI’s-Addiction-to-Gambling-Led-to-the-French-Revolution" class="headerlink" title="Louis XVI’s Addiction to Gambling Led to the French Revolution"></a>Louis XVI’s Addiction to Gambling Led to the French Revolution</h1><p>In 1777, Louis XVI ascended to the throne of France at the young age of 20. His reign was marked by many challenges, including a contentious relationship with the Parlement de Paris and an ongoing financial crisis. In addition, Louis XVI developed a severe gambling addiction that ultimately played a role in the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Gambling was incredibly popular in 18th century France, and Louis XVI was no exception. He became addicted to gambling early in his reign and spent hours each day playing games of chance, such as basset, faro, and écarté. The expenses associated with his addiction quickly began to mount, and he started borrowing money from friends and family members to finance his bets.</p>
<p>Louis XVI’s gambling addiction had serious consequences for both him and France as a whole. First, it caused immense financial strain on the country as Louis continued to lose money in ever-larger sums. Second, it created tension between Louis and his subjects. The French people were increasingly angry about the amount of money that their king was losing, and they saw his gambling as a sign of careless extravagance. This contributed to growing dissatisfaction with the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.</p>
<h1 id="Did-Marie-Antoinette-Influence-King-Louis-XVI’s-Gambling-Problem"><a href="#Did-Marie-Antoinette-Influence-King-Louis-XVI’s-Gambling-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Did Marie Antoinette Influence King Louis XVI’s Gambling Problem?"></a>Did Marie Antoinette Influence King Louis XVI’s Gambling Problem?</h1><p> perished through the guillotine during the French Revolution, many rumours circulated about her. One such rumour was that she had a major influence on her husband King Louis XVI’s gambling problem. Some experts believe that if it were not for her lavish spending, Louis XVI may not have had as much of a gambling problem. </p>
<p>Most historians believe that Marie Antoinette had little to no influence on Louis XVI’s gambling problem. Gambling was popular among the nobility during the 18th century, and it is unlikely that Marie Antoinette was the only one encouraging her husband to gamble. In fact, there is evidence that Louis XVI began gambling before he even met Marie Antoinette. </p>
<p>Some experts suggest that if Marie Antoinette had been more frugal with her spending, Louis XVI may have been less likely to gamble. However, it is also possible that Louis XVI would have found other ways to spend his money if Marie Antoinette had not been around. There is no clear evidence that Marie Antoinette was directly responsible for her husband’s gambling problem.</p>
