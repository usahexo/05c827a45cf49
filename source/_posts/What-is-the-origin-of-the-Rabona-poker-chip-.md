#  What is the origin of the Rabona poker chip? 

The Rabona poker chip is a casino chip that was designed by Italian artist Gianni Castiglione. The chip is named after the Rabona kick, an unconventional soccer move that was popularized by Argentine player Diego Maradona.

The Rabona poker chip is made from clay and has a diameter of 39 millimeters. It is available in two colors—white and red. The white Rabona poker chip features a black design that depicts a footballer executing a Rabona kick. The red Rabona poker chip features a white design that depicts a football being kicked.

The Rabona poker chip is used by several casinos in Europe, including the Casino Barrière de Lille, the Casino Municipale di Venezia, and the Spielbank Wiesbaden.

#  How many Rabona poker chips are in circulation? 

One of the most frequently asked questions about Rabona poker chips is just how many of them are in circulation. Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question as no one knows for certain how many Rabona poker chips were ever produced. However, there are a number of estimates that can give us a rough idea of how many Rabona poker chips could be in circulation.

One of the most commonly cited estimates is that there are around 5 million Rabona poker chips in circulation. This estimate was made by looking at the number of chips that have been used in live tournaments and extrapolating from there. Another estimate puts the number closer to 10 million, while yet another claims that there could be as many as 20 million Rabona poker chips in circulation.

No matter which estimate you believe, it’s clear that Rabona poker chips are one of the more popular types of poker chips on the market today. This popularity is likely due to their unique design and interesting backstory. In case you’re not familiar with them, Rabona poker chips were created by Italian designer Emilio Revi in collaboration with the Italian National Poker Team.

The design of the chip was inspired by the rabona football move, which is a type of kick where the player kicks the ball around their standing leg instead of striking it with their foot. The goal was to create a chip that would be instantly recognizable to players all over the world and would help to promote Italian poker culture abroad. And it seems like Revi and the National Poker Team have succeeded in their mission, as Rabona poker chips are now used in casinos all over Europe.
