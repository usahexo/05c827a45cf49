#  AFC Ajax Looking to Extend Unbeaten Streak with Win Over Blackjack

AFC Ajax will look to extend their unbeaten streak to 14 matches when they take on Blackjack in the Johan Cruijff ArenA in Amsterdam on Saturday.

Blackjack have not won a single match since September, while AFC Ajax have only lost once in their last 12 outings – a 2-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven.

Ajax manager Erik ten Hag is confident his side can get all three points against Blackjack this weekend.

"We're in good form at the moment and we're looking forward to Saturday's match," he said. "We'll be playing at home and we want to win. We'll do everything we can to get the three points."

Ten Hag could hand a first start of the season to defender Daley Blind, who has recently returned from injury. Striker Kasper Dolberg is also available after recovering from a bout of illness.

Blackjack manager Fred Grim expects a difficult match against AFC Ajax but remains hopeful his side can get something out of the game.

"Ajax are one of the best teams in Europe at the moment and they've been in great form lately," he said. "But we'll go there and give it our best shot. We'll be looking to create some chances and hopefully we can get something from the game."

Grim may opt to start top scorer Luuk de Jong up front, despite him being hampered by a hamstring injury. Defender Derrick Luckassen (knee) remains sidelined for Blackjack.

#  Blackjack Players Advised to Hit on 17 Against AFC Ajax

AFC Ajax is one of the top clubs in European football. The team is currently in first place in the Dutch Eredivisie. This season, they have only lost two league games and have conceded only nine goals.

Blackjack players looking to make a profit should hit on 17 when playing against AFC Ajax. This advice is based on the fact that the team has been very strong defensively this season. They are unlikely to concede many goals, which means that players stand a better chance of winning when they hit on 17 rather than stand.

#  Blackjack Variant Favors AFC Ajax in Matchup Against Blackjack
2. Blackjack has many variants, but the AFC Ajax edition is a clear favorite over the blackjack standard.

3. In the AFC Ajax game, players are dealt two cards and must make a choice: hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they have), or double down (double their bet and get one more card).
4. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose automatically. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
5. The blackjack variant favored by AFC Ajax gives players a better chance of winning than the traditional game. In this version, dealers must stand on all 17s, and players may double down on any two cards. This makes it much easier for players to reach 21 without busting.
6. While the traditional game offers some strategic choices, the AFC Ajax blackjack variant is much more forgiving and gives players a better chance at winning. So if you're looking for an edge in your next blackjack game, be sure to try out this variant!

#  AFC Ajax Expected to Cruise Past Blackjack With Ease

The Amsterdam ArenA outfit, AFC Ajax, are considered firm favourites when they come up against Blackjack in their coming fixture. The Dutch side is expected to win comfortably given the gulf in quality between the two sides.

Ajax are a club rich in history and pedigree, both of which they will be looking to showcase when they take on Blackjack. They are currently placed second in the Eredivisie standings, three points behind pace-setters PSV Eindhoven and look set to clinch a Champions League berth for next season.

Blackjack, on the other hand, languish at the bottom of the table and are pointless after 15 games. They have conceded a whopping 39 goals this season, making them one of the leakiest defences in Europe’s top five leagues. This is simply not a match-up that Ajax will lose.

Manager Erik ten Hag has a wealth of attacking talent at his disposal, with Dusan Tadic, Hakim Ziyech and David Neres all capable of scoring goals. In defence, meanwhile, captain Matthijs de Ligt looks set to make a big money move to one of Europe’s top clubs in the summer. He will be keen to show off his talents against Blackjack and help his side maintain their unbeaten run in all competitions this season.

Prediction: AFC Ajax 4-0 Blackjack

#  Blackjack Struggles to Keep Up With AFC Ajax in Early Innings

The Blackjacks were looking to sweep their two-game series against AFC Ajax, but the Dutch side proved to be too much in the early innings.

Ajax got on the board early with a goal from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the 3rd minute. Stefan de Vrij doubled their lead in the 18th minute, and Siem de Jong made it 3-0 just two minutes later.

The Blackjacks struggled to get anything going offensively in the first half, managing just three shots on goal. They were also guilty of conceding far too many chances to Ajax, who had 14 shots on goal in the first half alone.

However, they finally got on the scoreboard in the 47th minute when David Villa scored his fourth goal of the season. That would be as close as they would come though, as Ajax added two more goals late on to seal a 5-1 victory.

It was a disappointing result for the Blackjacks, who will now need to regroup ahead of their next match against FC Groningen.
