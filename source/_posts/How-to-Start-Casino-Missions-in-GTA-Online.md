#  A Guide to Starting Casino Missions in GTA Online

Are you looking for a new and exciting way to spend your time in GTA Online? Why not try your hand at casino missions? These can be a lot of fun, and can provide a serious challenge. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about starting casino missions.

Firstly, you’ll need to purchase the casino building. This can be done by speaking with Lester and selecting the ‘Investment property’ option. Once you have the casino, you’ll need to make a few upgrades. The first upgrade is the ‘security room’. This can be purchased from the in-game store, and will allow you to start the casino missions.

Once the security room is upgraded, you’ll need to speak with Mr. La Guardia. He can be found inside the casino, and will give you access to the casino missions. There are four different mission types: blackjack, poker, slots and roulette. In each mission type, there are five different levels of difficulty. The harder the level, the more rewards you’ll receive for completing it.

In blackjack, you’ll need to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than he does. In poker, you’ll compete against other players in a heads-up match. In slots, you’ll need to line up three or more symbols on a single payline in order to win prizes. And finally, in roulette, you’ll need to bet on where the ball will land after spinning around on a wheel with numbers from 0-36 printed on it.

If you manage to complete all five levels of a mission type, you’ll earn yourself a special reward! These rewards can include cash bonuses, new vehicles and even exclusive clothing items! So if you’re looking for something new and exciting to do in GTA Online, be sure to check out the casino missions!

#  Getting Started with Casino Missions in GTA Online

There's an entire world of opportunity waiting for you in the casino missions in GTA Online. These high-stakes challenges will put your poker skills, blackjack prowess and nerve to the ultimate test.

To get started, visit any of the three Los Santos casinos: the Vinewood Casino, the Fort Zancudo Airbase or the Humane Labs and Research facility. Once you're inside, look for the casino mission terminal to start betting big.

The casino missions come in a range of different flavors, from simple one-off challenges to ongoing tournaments. To get started, enter into a single player game and look for the Mission Wheel. From there, select either "Casino" or "Slot Machines."

The casino missions are a great way to make some serious cash, but they're also extremely risky. Make sure you have plenty of ammo and armor before heading in, and remember – it's all or nothing in these high-stakes games.

#  How to Start the Casino Missions in GTA Online

In order to start the casino missions in GTA Online, players need to have reached level 12 and purchased the High Roller Casino. Once those requirements have been met, players can access the mission by talking to Lester Crest at his home in Vinewood Hills.

The first objective of the casino missions is to win a certain amount of money from the casino’s table games. This can be done by playing roulette, blackjack, or slots. The objective is not as difficult as it may seem; with a bit of practice, players can easily make enough money to move on to the next stage of the casino missions.

The next objective is to win a high-stakes poker game. This can be accomplished by playing conservatively in the early rounds and building up a large stack of chips. As with the table games, it’s important to take into account probability when making decisions at the poker table; for example, it’s usually not worth chasing after a bad hand.

Finally, players must win a race around Mount Chiliad. This race can be difficult but it’s important to stay calm and focus on hitting all of the checkpoints. Utilizing power-ups and using shortcuts where possible can also give players an edge over their competitors.
