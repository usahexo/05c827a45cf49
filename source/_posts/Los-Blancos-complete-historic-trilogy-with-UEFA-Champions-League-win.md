#  Los Blancos complete historic trilogy with UEFA Champions League win

In what was a historic night at the Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine, Spanish giants Real Madrid completed an unprecedented treble by defeating Liverpool 3-1 in the UEFA Champions League final.

It was an enthralling match right from kickoff, with both sides going for the jugular.Liverpool applied pressure high up the pitch and created chances through their blistering counterattacks, while Madrid looked to break them down with their patient passing game.

The deadlock was finally broken in the 51st minute when Sadio Mane was adjudged to have brought down Madrid captain Sergio Ramos inside the penalty area.Real’s star player Cristiano Ronaldo coolly converted the resulting spot-kick to give his side the lead.

Liverpool hit back 10 minutes later through a magnificent overhead kick from goalkeeper Loris Karius’s pal Mo Salah.However, any hopes of a comeback were dashed moments later when Karius let a simple shot from Gareth Bale slip through his fingers to make it 2-1.

Ramos then put the icing on the cake for Madrid late on by scoring his side’s third goal following a mix-up between Karius and Virgil van Dijk. This was Ramos’s fourth Champions League title as captain, matching Paolo Maldini’s record.

Real Madrid’s players and fans reacted with joy and disbelief as they realised they had achieved something which had never been done before in Europe’s top club competition.This was their 13th European Cup/Champions League title, making them the most successful club in its history.

#  Ronaldo and Bale helpReal Madrid retain Champions League crown

Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were both on target as Real Madrid became the first team to retain their Champions League crown by beating Liverpool 3-1 in Saturday’s final at the NSC Olympiyskiy Stadium in Kiev.

Ronaldo, who scored twice in last year’s final, put Madrid ahead in the third minute with a low right-foot shot from 12 yards after being teed up by Karim Benzema.

Bale then made it 2-0 in the 61st minute, heading in Luka Modric’s lofted pass from close range, before Sadio Mane pulled one back for Liverpool in the 73rd minute.

Ronaldo completed his hat-trick with a penalty eight minutes from time after Mohamed Salah was brought down by goalkeeper Loris Karius.

The victory gives Madrid their fourth Champions League title in five years and their 13th European crown overall.

#  Zidane masterminds Real Madrid's third straight UCL victory

This season's UEFA Champions League has been one of the most thrilling in recent memory, with several top teams going out in spectacular fashion. But it was always going to be a question of whether Real Madrid or Barcelona would lift the trophy, and Los Blancos duly triumphed by outclassing their great rivals in the final.

Few people expected Zinedine Zidane's side to make it as far as they did this year, but they have proved their doubters wrong at every turn. The Frenchman has masterminded some scintillating performances, and his tactics played a big role in Madrid's 3-1 victory over Liverpool in the final.

One of his key decisions was to start Casemiro rather than the more attack-minded Isco, and the Brazilian midfielder put in a commanding display, breaking up Liverpool's attacks and providing a platform for his team-mates to launch counter-attacks.

Zidane also deserves credit for his substitutions; he brought on Marco Asensio for Lucas Vazquez shortly before halftime, and the Spanish youngster repaid his manager's faith with a stunning goal. And after Mohamed Salah had pulled one back for Liverpool, Zidane introduced Gareth Bale who scored an incredible overhead kick to seal Madrid's third straight UCL title.

Bale has come in for criticism this season, but there is no doubt that he is a world-class player when he is on form. And with Cristiano Ronaldo now departed from Madrid, Bale could be set for a starring role next season.

Zidane is certainly proving himself to be one of the best managers in Europe, and there is no doubt that he will continue to lead Madrid to success in future years.

#  Ronaldo, Bale headline Real Madrid's fourth European Cup triumph

Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale headlined Real Madrid’s fourth European Cup triumph as they defeated Juventus 4-1 in the final in Cardiff.

Ronaldo had already hit the post when he put Madrid ahead from the spot after 14 minutes, sending Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way.

Mario Mandzukic levelled for Juventus six minutes later, but Casemiro restored Madrid’s lead just before the break with a fine strike from distance.

Ronaldo then added a third with a well-taken header 12 minutes from time, and substitute Marco Asensio added a fourth in stoppage time.

#  Isco seals Real Madrid's fifth UEFA Champions League title

In a matchup that pitted two of the most successful clubs in European football history against each other, Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 to seal their fifth UEFA Champions League title.

It was an even contest in the first half, with both teams creating chances, but it was Real Madrid who took the lead right before halftime when Karim Benzema finished off a cross from Isco.

Liverpool came out firing in the second half and equalized not long after through Sadio Mane, but just a few minutes later Cristiano Ronaldo restored Real Madrid's lead with a header.

And then, in the last minute of regulation time, Gareth Bale made it 3-1 to seal the victory for Real Madrid and give them their third consecutive UEFA Champions League title.

As a result, Los Blancos become only the second team in history (after AC Milan) to have won five European Cups. And with Ronaldo set to leave the club this summer, they may very well be on their way to making that six.
