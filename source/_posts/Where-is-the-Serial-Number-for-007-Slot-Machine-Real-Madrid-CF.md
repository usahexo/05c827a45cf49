#  007 Slot Machine Goes Missing Ahead of Real Madrid Clash

A slot machine from the James Bond film “Casino Royale” has been stolen in Germany just days before a major Real Madrid match.

The machine was taken from a casino in the town of Mentzendorf, near the Dutch border. It’s not clear how the thieves got away with it, as the casino is in a locked and secured area.

It’s thought that the thieves may have used a truck to make their getaway.

Police are investigating and have released images of the machine in an effort to find it.

The machine is said to be worth around €250,000 (£215,000).

The theft has caused much amusement on social media, with some people joking that the thieves must be supporters of Real Madrid’s rivals Barcelona.

This isn’t the first time that something from a James Bond film has been stolen – in 2015, a gold bar from “Goldfinger” was taken from a museum in Switzerland.
