#  Wife unhappy with husband betting on Secret Order

For the last few months, my wife has been very unhappy with me. She says that I've been gambling away our money on the Secret Order, an online betting game. I don't know what to do. I really enjoy playing the game, and I think it's harmless. But my wife is insisting that I stop playing it, and she's even threatened to leave me if I don't.

I'm not sure what to do. On the one hand, I want to make my wife happy and stop playing the game. But on the other hand, I really enjoy playing the game and don't want to give it up. What should I do?

#  Wife concerned husband addicted to Secret Order

My wife’s been asking a lot of questions lately about my alleged addiction to the computer game Secret Order. She’s convinced it’s taken over my life and that I’m playing it all the time. I don’t know what to tell her. The truth is, I am obsessed with the game, but only because it’s so darn good!

Secret Order is an online adventure game that has you sorting through clues and completing tasks in order to save the world from a diabolical villain. It’s thrilling, suspenseful, and just plain fun. I never realized how addicted I was until my wife started bugging me about it. Now I have to find a way to balance my gaming time with my other responsibilities.

The good news is that Secret Order is a solo game, so there’s no one else relying on me to get things done. The bad news is that my wife keeps giving me dirty looks and making comments about how I need to put away the “toys” and get back to work. Sheesh! If only she could understand how much fun I’m having…

At any rate, I think it’s time for me to take a break from Secret Order for a while. Maybe after a few weeks or months I can come back and start playing again – but only for a limited amount of time each day! Gaming has become an important part of my life, but at least now I know that I need to be careful not to let it take over completely.

#  Wife upset over husband spending too much time on Secret Order

A wife in a Reddit thread is lamenting how her husband has been spending too much time on the "Secret Order" game. She says that he doesn't spend enough time with her and their kids and that he's been neglecting his responsibilities because of the game.

The husband, in turn, has posted in the thread saying that he's sorry for not spending enough time with his family but that he's been really enjoying the game. He also says that he's trying to find a way to balance his time between the game and his family but that it's been difficult.

Many people in the thread have chimed in, with some saying that the husband should simply quit the game if it's causing problems in his marriage while others are saying that the wife should be more understanding. Some people are even suggesting that the husband and wife play the game together so they can spend more time together.

What do you think? Should the husband quit the game or should the wife be more understanding? Let us know in the comments!

#  Wife not happy when husband gambling with Secret Order

Alice was not happy when she found out that her husband had been gambling with the Secret Order. She knew that it was a dangerous game, and she didn't want her husband to get hurt.

"It's just a harmless game," Bob said. "I'm not going to get hurt."

Alice wasn't convinced. She knew that the Secret Order was not a friendly organization. They were known for their ruthless behavior and their willingness to do whatever it took to win.

Bob continued to insist that it was just a game, but Alice was worried. She didn't want her husband to get hurt, and she didn't want him to get involved with the Secret Order.

The next time Bob went gambling with the Secret Order, Alice followed him. She wanted to make sure that he was safe and that he wasn't doing anything dangerous.

She watched him as he entered the building and then she followed him inside. She saw him go into the back room, where the gambling took place. And she saw him hand over his money to the other players.

Alice felt nervous as she watched her husband gamble with the Secret Order. She knew that it was a dangerous game, and she didn't want him to get hurt. But she also knew that he loved the excitement of playing against these dangerous criminals.

#  Wife wishes husband would stop betting on Secret Order

A wife in the UK has said she wishes her husband would stop betting on the Secret Order, as he has lost so much money on it. The wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said her husband has bet over £10,000 on the game in the past six months.

"It's been really hard watching him lose all that money," she said. "He's always been into gambling, but this is something else. I just wish he would stop."

The husband said he was confident that he would win back all of his losses. "I know I'm going to win back what I've lost," he said. "I've got a good feeling about this one."

However, his wife is less confident. "I don't know how much more he can lose," she said. "He's already down over £10,000. I just hope he stops before he loses any more."
