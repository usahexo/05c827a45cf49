#  Blancos primed for crowning glory

For much of the past decade, La Liga has been a two-horse race. Real Madrid and Barcelona have battled it out for supremacy, with Los Blancos coming out on top on a number of occasions.

However, this season could be different. With Barcelona enduring a turbulent campaign and Madrid’s rivals faltering, the Blancos look primed to clinch their first title in five years.

Zinedine Zidane’s side have been in impressive form all season long, and they currently sit four points clear at the top of the table. There is no doubt that they are the team to beat this year.

Barcelona, on the other hand, have been inconsistent throughout the campaign. The Blaugrana have never really looked like challenging Madrid for the title, and they now find themselves in third place – ten points behind their rivals.

It has been a very disappointing season for them, and they will need to improve if they are to compete next year.

Elsewhere in La Liga, Atletico Madrid have also had an up-and-down season. Diego Simeone’s side are currently in second place, but they could easily drop down the table if they continue to perform inconsistently.

Sevilla and Valencia are both potential contenders for Champions League qualification, while teams such as Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal could still make a late run for Europa League qualification.

In short, there is still plenty of drama left to play out in La Liga this season. However, it is looking increasingly likely that Madrid will be crowned champions in May.

#  Mourinho's men still the team to beat

The Premier League is back and it looks as if Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United are still the team to beat. United have started the season in excellent form, winning all of their opening three games.

Mourinho has made some big signings over the summer, including £75m midfielder Paul Pogba and striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. These new arrivals have added some much-needed firepower to United’s attack, with the team looking far more dangerous going forward this season.

Ibrahimovic has been particularly impressive so far, scoring two goals in his first three Premier League appearances. The Swede is undoubtedly a major asset for United and will be key to their title challenge this season.

United also have a solid defence, led by Spanish veteran centre-back Sergio Ramos Ramos. The 31-year-old has been in excellent form for both club and country over the past few years and will be looking to lead United to glory this season.

Mourinho’s side are currently the favourites to win the Premier League title, but they will face stiff competition from rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. Pep Guardiola’s City have spent over £200m on new players this summer and look like they could be serious challengers this season.

Antonio Conte’s Chelsea have also made some big signings over the summer, including Spanish striker Alvaro Morata and Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard. These new arrivals have added some much-needed quality to Chelsea’s squad and they will be hoping to challenge for the title this season.

#  Pepe: We can do it 

The alt-right frog, Pepe, is back in the headlines. This time, he's been repurposed as an unofficial symbol of the "We can do it!" movement, aimed at boosting morale among American workers in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory.

Pepe was first popularized by Matt Furie in 2005, appearing in a comic strip called "Boy's Club." The character was adopted by online message boards and forums as a way to express dissatisfaction with the status quo. In recent years, Pepe has been repurposed by the alt-right as a racist and anti-Semitic symbol.

Now, Furie is fighting back against the alt-right's use of his creation. In an interview with The Guardian, Furie said: "It’s just a phase, it’s not anything that I endorse or support. I try to discourage any kind of hateful rhetoric or anti-Semitic stuff."

In light of the alt-right's use of Pepe, some have called for the frog to be designated as a hate symbol. However, others have argued that the frog should be reclaimed and used as a symbol of resistance against the alt-right.

Regardless of where you stand on Pepe, it's clear that he has become a powerful icon in contemporary politics.

#  Ronaldo confident of Champions League success

Cristiano Ronaldo has said that he is confident of Juventus' chances of winning the Champions League this season. The Portuguese forward, who left Real Madrid for the Italian champions in the summer, spoke to reporters after scoring in Juve's 2-0 win over Lazio on Saturday.

"I feel good. I'm enjoying myself and I'm confident about our chances of winning the Champions League," he said. "We're going to fight until the end to win this trophy."

Ronaldo has made a flying start to life at Juventus, scoring seven goals in his first eight appearances for the club. His goal against Lazio was his 100th in Serie A and he now has his sights set on Champions League glory.

Juventus have been drawn in Group D alongside Manchester United, Valencia and Young Boys and they begin their campaign against Valencia on September 19. Ronaldo will be hoping to lead them all the way to the final in Madrid next May.

#  Madrid determined to make history

In the Spanish capital, there is a determination to make history in this year’s Champions League. With both clubs in the semi-finals, it is the first time that both clubs have reached this stage of the competition in the same season.

Atlético Madrid are Europa League champions and they will be looking to upset their city rivals Real Madrid, who are seeking their third consecutive Champions League title.

For Atlético manager Diego Simeone, it is an opportunity to finally get one over on his former club and goalkeeper Jan Oblak said that they are not afraid of Real Madrid. “We don’t fear Real Madrid – we respect them but we don’t fear them. We will do everything possible to reach the final. I am confident we can achieve this,” said Oblak.

Atlético have reached two Champions League finals in the past four seasons but have been beaten by city rivals Real Madrid on both occasions. This time around, they will be determined not to let that happen again.

Real Madrid are bidding for an historic fourth Champions League title in a row and manager Zinedine Zidane knows just how important it is to make history. He said: “It would be historical for us and we want to make it happen. It’s hard to do what we want to do but nothing is impossible. We know how difficult it is going to be but we will give everything on the pitch as always and see what happens at the end.”

Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was also looking ahead to the match with Atlético and he knows that they will need to be at their best if they want to progress to the final. “In theory, it should be an open tie because both teams are very equal but in reality, when you face Atlético Madrid anything can happen, they know how to suffer and play with intensity so we need a great game from us from start to finish if we want to advance,” he said.
