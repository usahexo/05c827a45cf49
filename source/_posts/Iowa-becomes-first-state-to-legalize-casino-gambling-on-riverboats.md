#  Iowa becomes first state to legalize casino gambling on riverboats

Des Moines, Iowa - In a landmark decision today, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that casino gambling is legal on riverboats. This makes Iowa the first state in the nation to allow casino gambling on boats.

The court's ruling overturns a previous law that had prohibited casino gambling on riverboats. The new law will allow casinos to operate on riverboats that are at least 150 feet long and 28 feet wide.

Opponents of the bill have argued that it will lead to increased crime and social ills. But supporters say that the additional tax revenue generated by gambling will help pay for vital services such as education and public health.

Governor Chet Culver praised the court's decision, saying that it will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. He vowed to work with the legislature to implement the new law as quickly as possible.

#  Missouri may be next state to legalize casino gambling on riverboats

Missouri is considering legalizing casino gambling on riverboats, with the potential to bring in up to $125 million in annual tax revenue.

If the bill is approved, Missouri would join 12 other states that have legalized casino gambling on riverboats.

The proposed legislation would allow for up to six casino licenses to be issued, each with a maximum of 1,500 slot machines and 72 table games. The licensees would be required to operate their casinos on boats that cruise on the Missouri River or its tributaries.

Sponsors of the bill say that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents argue that it will lead to increased social ills such as problem gambling.

Casino gambling is currently legal in Missouri at casinos owned by Native American tribes. There are six tribal casinos in the state, with more than 2,000 slot machines and 60 table games.

#  Ohio considers legalizing casino gambling on riverboats

Ohio is one of the states in the US that is currently considering legalizing casino gambling on riverboats. If this happens, it will be a major development for the gambling industry in the United States.

The main reason why Ohio is considering legalizing casino gambling on riverboats is to generate additional revenue for the state. This is because casino gambling is a lucrative industry, and legalizing it in Ohio could bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue every year.

In addition to generating revenue, there are also other benefits to legalizing casino gambling on riverboats. These include creating jobs and stimulating the economy. By legalizing casino gambling, Ohio can create thousands of jobs for its residents, which will help stimulate the economy.

Another benefit of legalizing casino gambling is that it will provide more entertainment options for residents and tourists. Casino gambling can be fun and exciting, and it can attract people to visit Ohio from other states. This will help boost the tourism industry in Ohio and generate additional revenue for the state.

There are some concerns that need to be addressed before Ohio decides to legalize casino gambling on riverboats. One concern is that casino gambling can be addictive and cause financial ruin for people who participate in it. Another concern is that it could lead to increased crime rates and social problems.

Despite these concerns, there are many reasons why Ohio should legalize casino gambling on riverboats. The benefits mentioned above outweigh the risks, and Ohio stands to gain a lot by legalizing this type of gambling.

#  Indiana prepares to allow casino gambling on riverboats

Indiana legislators are moving forward with a plan to legalize casino gambling on riverboats, following the lead of other states in the region. The measure has strong bipartisan support and is expected to pass both chambers of the state legislature.

Supporters of the bill say it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state. Indiana faces a $1.8 billion budget shortfall for the fiscal year 2020, and casino gambling could provide a significant boost to state coffers.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and social ills. They also warn that it could cannibalize business at existing casinos in the state.

If passed, the bill would allow up to 10 riverboat casinos in Indiana. The boats would be allowed to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Casino gambling is already legal in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio. Kentucky recently legalized casino gambling on land, and Michigan is considering a similar measure.

#  Illinois among states considering legalizing casino gambling on riverboats

Illinois lawmakers are looking at legalizing casino gambling on riverboats as a way to help solve the state's budget crisis.

House Speaker Michael Madigan says that he is talking to Gov. Bruce Rauner about the possibility of legalizing casino gambling on riverboats as a way to increase state revenue.

There are currently 10 casinos in Illinois, and they bring in more than $1 billion in annual revenue. But the state has been struggling financially in recent years, and lawmakers are looking for ways to increase revenue.

 legalizing casino gambling on riverboats could be a solution for Illinois. The boats could be moved to different parts of the state, and it could bring in millions of dollars in revenue each year.

But there are some concerns about legalizing casino gambling on riverboats. Some people worry that it could lead to an increase in crime and addiction problems. And others argue that it would be better to invest in other types of tourism instead of gambling.

Illinois is just one of several states considering legalizing casino gambling on riverboats. Lawmakers in Missouri and Iowa are also looking at the possibility of legalizing gambling on boats, and it could be a major issue during this year's legislative session.
